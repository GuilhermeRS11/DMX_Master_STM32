# DMX Master STM32

## Overview

The **DMX-Master-STM32** is part of an integrated system that includes a **graphical interface for Windows**, developed in **PyQt**. This interface allows users to send DMX commands, interact with RDM devices, and visualize DMX/RDM frames in real time. Communication between the software and the board occurs via **USB-C**, enabling control and monitoring of connected devices.

In addition to this software integration, the board also features its **own embedded graphical interface**, displayed on a **0.96'' OLED screen** and controlled via **four physical buttons**.

**Currently, development is focused on the hardware, with the PCB already designed and completed. The firmware and embedded graphical interface are still under development.**

The PCB was designed using **Altium Designer 25.1.2**, while the firmware is being developed with **STM32Cube 1.14.1**.

## Embedded Graphical Interface

The onboard graphical interface allows users to configure and control **DMX and RDM** devices directly, without requiring the external software. The interactive menus enable:
- Adjustment of DMX and RDM parameters.
- Configuration of device addressing.
- Monitoring of received information.
- Direct control via physical buttons.

Thus, if the graphical software is unavailable, the board can be powered by **5V** and used independently.

## About the DMX-Master-STM32 Project

The **DMX-Master-STM32** is responsible for receiving data via **USB-C**, interpreting it, and converting it to the **DMX standard**, enabling communication with lighting and control devices. It can operate either when connected to the PC GUI or autonomously.

### PCB Features:
- **USB-C connectivity** for communication with external software.
- **5V -> 3.3V voltage regulator** for safe circuit operation.
- **CH340G USB converter** for serial interface.
- **STM32C031K6T6 microcontroller** for processing and control.
- **MAX485 converter** for RS485 interface, compatible with DMX.
- **4 physical buttons** for direct interaction with the board.
- **128x64 OLED display (0.96'')** with menus and manual adjustments.
